== Specs (brainstorming state) ==

- Auth

  - We only auth once with Twitter Oauth
  - We need to store the auth somewhere that can be accessed
    accross the Bot interface

- Status

  - There are many kinds of Questions
  - A Question can be answered, and then replied

  - An Answer is a Status that only contains few params
    but doesn't have a body (json)

  - An Answer can be sent since it is a Status

  Status(optional: [text, json]);

- Examples:

  s = new Status("Hello World!");
  s.send()

  s = new Status(json);
  s.send() 			  // Throws a "Duplicated Status"

  answer = s.answer() // Returns an Answer() Object, which is a Status()
                      // object with only a text and in_reply_to_status_id 
                      // variables setted

  answer.reply() 	    // Calls Status.send()
  answer.privateReply() // Sends a Direct Message to User instead

  // We can also directly create an Answer to a Question
  answer = new Answer(question)

  // Later on we could add more reply options
  answer.retweet()
  answer.email()
  answer.fb()

  // What about chaining them ?
  answer.reply().email().fb().send() // Each one returns the answer object
           |       |      |     |
        Each one fires asynchronously

  // More fun 
  new Question(answer.question)
